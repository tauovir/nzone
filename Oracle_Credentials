SYS : 
All base tables and views for the database data dictionary are stored in the SYS schema. These base tables and views are critical for the operation of Oracle Database XE. To maintain the integrity of the data dictionary, tables in the SYS schema are manipulated only by the database. They should never be modified by any user or database administrator. You must not create any tables in the SYS schema.
