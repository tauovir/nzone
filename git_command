#=============GIT BRANCH=========
git branch : check branches
git checkout branch_name : switch between branch
git checkout -b branch_name :  create new branch
git branch -d khan1 : Delete branch
git branhc -a :  see all available branch

git checkout model/khan1_file.txt : Send khan1_file file to previous state

HEAD : Means pointer to last commit
Telling here to do something to last commit
HEAD ~1 : ~1 tells further commit, so instead of last commit it goes to further 1 commit and last commit completely unstage 

git reset 825e04378ce3d51c6d54bdedf1be6301f4ab707f : unstage to mentioned commit id

git reset --hard 825e04378ce3d51c6d54bdedf1be6301f4ab707f : completelely remove code to this committed id

========================GIT STASH======================
Stash : secrete storage place:
 we use git stash command , when are are working on particular branch and did not complete it, and we need to switch to diifferent branch 
because we need to do some urgent work: Here we should not stage adn commit uncomplete work,therefore git stash place uncomplete code to temprary storage area. When we back to our working branch we can pop stash and start working on uncomplete task

git stash : place code to temperrly storage
git stash pop : bring back stashed code

OR
git stash save "message" : save your modified file to temporary space
git stash list :  to see stash list
git stash pop :  pop stash list oR bring stashed code which was not staged/commit
 git stash pop just pop one by one stash(also delete stash simultanesously)

git stash apply stash@{0}(stash_code) this command work same as git stash pop but does not delete any stash,using this command we can bring
 code back of particular stash

git stash clear: Clear all stash(free space)
git stash drop stash@{1} :  drop particular stash


=====================GET Undo Laste pull requet============
git reflog
git reset --hard HEAD@{1} : it will reset your local code to specified head
